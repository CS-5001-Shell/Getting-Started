# Lab 1 - Getting Started

In this assignment, you will set up your Python development environment and submit your solution vit GitHub. Here are a few additional notes regarding setup of your environment: [https://github.com/CS-5001-Shell/Resources/blob/main/guides/getting_started.md](https://github.com/CS-5001-Shell/Resources/blob/main/guides/getting_started.md)

The topics you will practice and apply in this assignment include algorithm design, expressions, and variables.

## Part 1 - Set up your Python environment

Download the Python development environment version 3.12.5 or greater from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).By default, Python installs the Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE); however, it is recommend that you download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

We will use VSCode for the demonstrations in class. You may also use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and a command line interface.

## Part 2 - Set up GitHub

Make sure you have created a new user account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and included your username in the Background Survey. 

Set up your computer to access your user account on GitHub. There are *many* ways to upload your work to GitHub, and we will demonstrate how to do this through VSCode. You will eventually need to learn to use git from the [command line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line). You may also wish to download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) instead.

## Part 3 - Complete the code described in the four starter Python files in your Lab 1 repository

**Exercise 1:** Print a house.

**Exercise 2:** Use variables to store and print your favorite song lyrics.

**Exercise 3:** Calculate the difference, product, and average of two numbers.

**Exercise 4:** Calculate the time an alarm will expire.

## Assignment Submission

Step 1 - *Stage Changes*: Select the Source Control icon in the VSCode left menu. In the Changes section, click the + to *Stage All Changes*.

Step 2 - Commit Message: In the text box that says Message enter a meaningful message that describes the change you just completed.

Step 3 - *Commit & Push*: Select the down arrow in the blue box that says Commit. Choose 



   - Enter a meaningful commit message.
   - *Commit & Push* your changes.
   - Visit the repository on GitHub to confirm that your changes were uploaded successfully

*Congratulations! You have just completed your first computer science assignment!*
