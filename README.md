# Lab 1 - Getting Started

In this assignment, you will set up your Python development environment and submit your solution vit GitHub. Here are a few additional notes regarding setup of your environment: [https://github.com/CS-5001-Shell/Resources/blob/main/guides/getting_started.md](https://github.com/CS-5001-Shell/Resources/blob/main/guides/getting_started.md)

The topics you will practice and apply in this assignment include algorithm design, expressions, and variables.

## Part 1 - Set up your Python environment

Download the Python development environment version 3.12.5 or greater from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).By default, Python installs the Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) that can be used to do all of the development in this course. However, you are free to download another Integrated Development Environment (IDE) if you would prefer a different one. 

All of the demonstrations in class will be on a Mac using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and the Terminal. It is my strong recommendation that you use this approach; though, some students prefer to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Part 2 - Set up GitHub

Make sure you have created a new user account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and included your username in the Background Survey. 

Set up your computer to access your user account on GitHub. There are *many* ways to upload your work to GitHub. You will eventually need to learn to use git from the [command line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line). [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) is, however, a bit more intuitive. You may wish to use it for your assignments. Both will be demonstrated in class.

## Part 3 - Complete the code described in the four starter Python files in your Lab 1 repository

**Exercise 1:** Print a house.

**Exercise 2:** Use variables to store and print your favorite song lyrics.

**Exercise 3:** Calculate the difference, product, and average of two numbers.

**Exercise 4:** Calculate the time an alarm will expire.

## Assignment Submission

To earn credit for this assignment you must commit all of your changes to your GitHub repository prior to the deadline. It is strongly recommended that you commit your changes regularly. Do not wait until you complete all four parts of the assignment to upload your (partial) solution.

Step 1: If you are using GitHub Desktop, select "Commit to main" at the bottom left. Make sure to provide a meaningful Summary and Description. 

Step 2: Select the "Push origin" button. This is extremely important as your changes will not be reflected on GitHub until you complete this step.

Step 3: Using your web browser, navigate to your repository on GitHub.com. Look at your .py files in the browser to make sure they are the most recent version.

*Congratulations! You have just completed your first computer science assignment!*
