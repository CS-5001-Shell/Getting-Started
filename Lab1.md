<hr/>

In this assignment, you will set up your Python development environment and submit your solution vit GitHub. Here are a few additional notes regarding setup of your environment: [https://github.com/CS-5001-Fall-2024/Resources/tree/main/guides](https://github.com/CS-5001-Fall-2024/Resources/tree/main/guides)

The topics you will practice and apply in this assignment include algorithm design, expressions, and variables.

**[5 points]**

Join the Microsoft Team that we will use for communication in this class via this link: [CS 5001 - OAK - Fall 2024](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3A9nlYBJIFq3KpzcLYnx-qEezgyGMYCAnvlTI-eppIXh81%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=28ae1c9a-c508-4f79-9854-ec6d06de5211&tenantId=a8eec281-aaa3-4dae-ac9b-9a398b9215e70)

Make sure you keep a close eye on this team. All announcements will be posted here. This is also where you will go to ask questions about your assignments. I encourage you to use this liberally!

## Part 1 - Set up your Python environment

Download the Python development environment version 3.12.5 or greater from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).By default, Python installs the Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE) that can be used to do all of the development in this course. However, you are free to download another Integrated Development Environment (IDE) if you would prefer a different one. 

All of the demonstrations in class will be on a Mac using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and the Terminal. It is my strong recommendation that you use this approach; though, some students prefer to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Part 2 - Set up GitHub

Create a new user account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and include your username in your responses to the Background SurveyLinks to an external site.. There are *many* ways to upload your work to GitHub. You will eventually need to learn to use git from the [command line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line). [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) is, however, a bit more intuitive. You may wish to use it for your assignments. Both will be demonstrated in class.
